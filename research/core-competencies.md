Core Competencies
Strategic, differentiated, and investor-ready.

1. Integrated Nutrition-First Care Delivery
   Core strength: You combine food, primary care, behavioral health, and care coordination into one unified clinical model.
   Why it matters:
   Hospitals and payers struggle to manage high-risk, nutrition-related chronic conditions. CenaHealth operationalizes a full-stack Food-as-Healthcare model—something no one else has truly pulled off—and ties it directly to measurable clinical and cost outcomes.
   Your edge:
   Medically tailored meals + produce prescriptions
   RDN + BHN + PCP services under one clinical umbrella
   AI-assisted workflows to track adherence, outcomes, and risk
   This is your secret sauce: the wraparound model that closes gaps no single vendor can address.

2. Tech-Enabled Value-Based Care Infrastructure
   Core strength: Your model isn’t just meals or coaching — it’s a care delivery system supported by custom technology.
   Why it matters:
   Hospitals need turnkey infrastructure that makes VBC manageable without adding admin burden.
   Your edge:
   VozCare (provider dashboard): risk stratification, care plans, nutrition tracking, billing workflows
   AVA (AI engagement agent): daily check-ins, symptom flagging, behavior prompts
   AthenaOne-integrated tooling (EHR + billing backbone)
   Unified outcomes reporting aligned to CMS metrics
   This competency signals to investors: “We’re not a meal company. We’re a platform.”

3. Turnkey Implementation for Hospitals & MCOs
   Core strength: You can launch a fully functional Food-as-Healthcare program in 60–90 days.
   Why it matters:
   Health systems love the concept of nutrition interventions… but hate operational complexity. CenaHealth removes the friction.
   Your edge:
   Defined PMPM + care coordination pricing model
   Implementation playbooks
   Provider training + credentialing workflows
   Built-in QA, SDOH screening, and outcomes reporting
   Plug-and-play with existing RCM + population health teams
   This is why Kaiser, Hartford Healthcare, Vanderbilt, and others lean in.

4. Culturally Grounded Culinary + Clinical Expertise
   Core strength: You deliver nutrition that actually reflects patients’ identities — and that drives adherence.
   Why it matters:
   Food-as-Medicine fails when food is bland, unfamiliar, or culturally disconnected.
   Your edge:
   Nationally scalable culturally relevant menus
   Inclusive recipe development
   Real-world adherence driven by taste and cultural pride
   Ability to tailor for chronic conditions, ethnic communities, and regional partners

This makes CenaHealth uniquely effective in diverse communities — a massive market advantage.

5. Deep Partnerships Across Hospitals, Academia & Community
   Core strength: You’ve built trust with stakeholders who rarely collaborate this smoothly.
   Why it matters:
   This positions CenaHealth as a health equity engine that can scale statewide and nationally.
   Your edge:
   Hospital MSAs (UConn, Hartford HealthCare, St. Francis)
   National interest (Kaiser Mid-Atlantic, Northwell, Vanderbilt, Nuvance)
   Academic partnerships with research teams (Dr. Wu, Dr. Dieckhaus)
   Community partners: Forge City Works, grocery partners, local chefs

This competency proves legitimacy, traction, and scalability.

6. Data-Driven Outcomes Aligned to CMS & VBC Metrics
   Core strength: You don’t just provide meals — you measure, report, and prove impact.
   Why it matters:
   Hospitals, Medicaid MCOs, and CMS care deeply about:
   readmission reduction
   HbA1c improvement
   weight loss
   medication deprescribing
   patient engagement metrics

Your edge:
Quantitative clinical outcomes
Behavior + adherence data from AVA
Cost savings for shared savings contracts
Longitudinal reporting for PMPM contracts
This is your key to government and payer expansion.

7. Operational Excellence in Meal Distribution & Logistics
   Core strength: You can reliably feed entire populations without running your own kitchen.
   Why it matters:
   Scalability requires outsourced production + strong QA — not building more kitchens.
   Your edge:
   Local + national production partners (FCW + national suppliers)
   Defined SOPs for packaging, delivery, menus
   40% margin structure
   Culturally tailored MTMs at scale
   Home delivery + pickup models
   This proves you’re built to scale beyond Connecticut.
