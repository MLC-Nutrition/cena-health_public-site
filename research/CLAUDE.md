# Research Directory Rules

## Purpose of This Directory

The `/research/` directory contains market research, competitive intelligence, sitemaps, and strategic planning documents. When working in this directory, focus on **analysis, discovery, and strategic thinking** - not implementation.

## Working with Research Documents

### When Analyzing Competitors

Reference: [competitors.md](competitors.md), [competitor-sitemaps.md](competitor-sitemaps.md)

**Key Questions to Answer:**
1. What do they position as? (vendor, platform, service?)
2. What outcomes do they claim?
3. What's their primary audience?
4. What gaps exist in their offering vs. CenaHealth?
5. How do they structure their messaging?

**Output Format:**
- Comparison tables (CenaHealth vs. Competitor)
- Gap analysis (what they miss that we solve)
- Messaging opportunities (how we differentiate)
- Proof point needs (what data would strengthen our position)

### When Creating Sitemaps

Reference: [investor-partner-sitemap.md](investor-partner-sitemap.md), [generalized-sitemap.md](generalized-sitemap.md), [multi-site-architecture.md](multi-site-architecture.md)

**Sitemap Structure Principles:**
1. **Audience-first navigation** - User chooses path based on role/maturity
2. **Outcome-driven sections** - Every section title should hint at benefit
3. **Progressive disclosure** - Essential info first, depth on click
4. **Conversion-optimized** - Clear CTAs throughout
5. **Proof-heavy** - Metrics, case studies, testimonials at every level

**Required Elements:**
- Clear section hierarchy (H1 > H2 > H3)
- CTAs at section endings
- Cross-links to related content
- Download opportunities for gated content
- Conversion tracking points

**Sitemap Template Structure:**
```markdown
## Section Name
**Primary Message:** One-sentence value prop

### Key Elements:
- Core content points
- Proof points (metrics, case studies)
- Visual elements needed
- Interactive components

**CTA:** Specific next action →
```

### When Researching Core Competencies

Reference: [core-competencies.md](core-competencies.md)

**Our 7 Strategic Advantages:**
1. Integrated Nutrition-First Care Delivery
2. Tech-Enabled Value-Based Care Infrastructure

4. Culturally Grounded Culinary + Clinical Expertise
5. Deep Partnerships Across Hospitals, Academia & Community
6. Data-Driven Outcomes Aligned to CMS & VBC Metrics

**When writing copy, always:**
- Reference specific competencies by name
- Tie features back to these advantages
- Use competencies to structure "Why Us" sections
- Connect competencies to target audience pain points

### Research Documentation Standards

#### File Naming
- Use kebab-case: `competitor-analysis.md`

## Research Questions to Always Ask

When analyzing anything:

1. **Who cares?** Which audience segment is this relevant to?
2. **Why now?** What makes this timely or urgent?
3. **Compared to what?** What's the baseline or alternative?
4. **So what?** What's the implication for CenaHealth?
5. **What proof?** What evidence supports or contradicts this?
6. **What action?** What should we do with this information?
