---

## 2. The Infrastructure Problem We Solve

**Section Focus:** The missing layer between medical nutrition prescriptions and actual outcomes

### 2.1 The Gap in Healthcare

- $25B in annual preventable readmission penalties
- 90% of health systems lack nutrition intervention infrastructure
- Community partnerships generate no clinical data or revenue
- Value-based care contracts penalize poor population health outcomes

### 2.2 Why Point Solutions Fail

- **Meal delivery companies:** No clinical integration, no data, no outcomes
- **Care coordination platforms:** No food component, no cultural relevance
- **Hospital programs:** Too complex to scale, no shared savings model
- **The Missing Infrastructure:** No one connects prescription-based care + clinical data + revenue generation

### 2.3 What Infrastructure Actually Means

**Three Integration Layers:**

- **Data Layer:** Collecting structured + unstructured clinical data that proves ROI
- **Care Layer:** RDNs, BHNs, care coordination (what food vendors don't provide)
- **Food Layer:** Disease-specific, culturally tailored meal prescriptions (what clinical teams can't do alone)

**CTA:** See How We Built It →

---

## 3. Solution by Maturity Level

**Section Focus:** Tailored pathways based on organizational readiness

### 3.1 For Health Systems Starting SDOH Strategy

### 3.2 For Health Systems with Existing Community Partnerships

**Core Need:** Infrastructure that transforms community investments into revenue generators

**Pain Points:**

- Food programs generate no clinical data

## 4. Core Differentiators: What Makes This Infrastructure

**Section Focus:** Why this is healthcare infrastructure, not a food program

### 4.1 Prescriber, Not Food Vendor

- **Medical-grade precision:** End-stage renal ≠ uncontrolled diabetes ≠ cardiac disease
- **Clinical care plans:** Individualized to patient conditions and culture
- **Provider-driven:** Prescription-based nutrition as medical intervention

### 4.2 Infrastructure, Not Meal Delivery

**Three-Layer Integration:**

- **Data layer:** VozCare platform captures every clinical touchpoint
- **Care layer:** Integrated team (RDNs, BHNs, MDs, coordinators)
- **Food layer:** Multi-vendor partnerships for patient choice and cultural relevance

**Impact:** Community-based organizations prove clinical impact and participate in shared savings

### 4.3 Revenue Generation, Not Cost Center

- **Shared savings model:** Hospitals generate revenue while improving outcomes
- **Proven ROI:** 30% fewer hospitalizations = $3,200 annual savings per patient
- **Unique approach:** Community organizations contribute to hospital revenue through measurable clinical impact

### 4.4 Continuity of Care

- **EHR integration:** Epic, Athena, Cerner integration closes loop with medical team
- **Real-time dashboards:** AI-powered clinical decision support for providers
- **Scalable automation:** Manage 1,000+ patients without proportional staff increase
