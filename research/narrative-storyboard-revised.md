# Cena Health Narrative Storyboard (Revised Focus)

**Core Positioning Shift:**
- FROM: Solving food insecurity (charity framing)
- TO: Solving nutrition insecurity for chronic care patients (clinical framing)

**The Strategic Frame:**
We're not feeding hungry people. We're healing sick people with precision nutrition.

---

## Act 1: The Problem Nobody's Solving

### Opening Hook: The $25B Question

**Headline:** Hospitals are losing $25 billion annually on preventable readmissions—and nutrition is the missing treatment.

**The Setup:**
Healthcare has gotten really good at treating acute disease. Surgery, medications, procedures—we can stabilize almost anyone.

But we're terrible at keeping chronically ill patients healthy once they leave the hospital.

**The Stat That Stops Them:**
- 6 in 10 Americans have nutrition-related chronic conditions
- 30-40% of hospital readmissions are preventable with proper nutrition intervention
- Hospitals pay penalties for these readmissions—$25B annually

**The Provocative Question:**
What if the problem isn't food insecurity? What if it's **nutrition insecurity**?

---

### The Difference That Changes Everything

**Food Insecurity:** Not having enough to eat
→ **Solution:** Give people food (pantries, meal programs, SNAP benefits)

**Nutrition Insecurity:** Not having access to the *medically appropriate* nutrition needed to manage chronic disease
→ **Solution:** Prescribe and deliver medically-tailored nutrition as treatment

**Why This Distinction Matters:**

A patient with **end-stage renal disease** needs:
- <2g sodium, <2g potassium, <1g phosphorus per meal
- NOT just "healthy food" or "more food"
- This is medical nutrition therapy—as precise as any prescription

A patient with **uncontrolled diabetes** needs:
- Low glycemic index carbs, consistent carb counting, heart-healthy fats
- NOT just "avoid sugar"
- This is clinical intervention—as specific as insulin dosing

A patient with **congestive heart failure** needs:
- Strict sodium restriction, fluid management, nutrient-dense meals
- NOT just "eat healthier"
- This is disease management—as critical as their diuretic medication

**The Realization:**
You wouldn't send a diabetic patient home with "some insulin"—you'd prescribe the exact dose they need.

Why do we send chronic care patients home with "eat healthy" instead of prescribing the exact nutrition they need?

---

### What Providers Are Trying (And Why It's Not Working)

**Scenario 1: The Discharge Coordinator's Dilemma**

Patient: 68-year-old with diabetes, CHF, and CKD
Discharged: With medication list and "dietary guidelines"
Reality: Lives alone, limited income, doesn't understand renal diet restrictions
Result: Readmitted in 22 days with fluid overload and hyperkalemia

**The coordinator knows nutrition matters. But she has no way to:**
- Prescribe specific meals for multiple conditions
- Ensure patient gets medically-tailored food at home
- Track whether patient is following the plan
- Prove clinical impact to justify the program cost

---

**Scenario 2: The Care Manager's Frustration**

Program: Community food partnerships providing "healthy meals"
Budget: $400K annually
CFO's question: "What's the ROI?"
Answer: "We don't know. We have no data."

**The care manager knows community partners are valuable. But she has:**
- No clinical integration (food program separate from medical care)
- No outcomes tracking (did meals improve HbA1c? Reduce hospitalizations?)
- No revenue model (pure cost center, always at risk of being cut)
- No way to scale (manual coordination across multiple partners)

---

**Scenario 3: The Medical Director's Vision**

Goal: Launch hospital-wide nutrition intervention program
Challenge: Build infrastructure that integrates food + clinical care + data + revenue model
Timeline: Board wants results in 18 months
Reality: It would take 3+ years to build in-house

**The medical director knows this should exist. But building it requires:**
- Dietitian recruitment and training
- Food vendor partnerships (with quality standards)
- Care coordination platform
- EHR integration
- Outcomes measurement systems
- Billing and revenue cycle management
- Community partnerships
- Cultural competency for diverse populations

That's not a program. That's infrastructure. And nobody's built it.

---

### The Infrastructure Gap

**What exists:**
- **Meal delivery companies:** Send food (no clinical integration, no disease specificity)
- **Care coordination platforms:** Manage patients (no food component)
- **Hospital nutrition departments:** Clinical expertise (can't scale, can't coordinate home delivery)
- **Community food programs:** Good intentions (no clinical data, no revenue model)

**What doesn't exist:**
A turnkey infrastructure platform that provides:
1. **Medical-grade precision** (disease-specific nutrition prescriptions)
2. **Clinical care coordination** (RDNs, BHNs, care teams)
3. **Outcomes data collection** (proving clinical and financial impact)
4. **Revenue generation** (shared savings from reduced utilization)
5. **Scalable automation** (serve thousands of patients without proportional staff growth)

**That's the gap we built infrastructure to fill.**

---

## Act 2: The Solution (The "No-Brainer")

### What We Actually Do

**We're not a meal delivery service.**
**We're clinical infrastructure for treating chronic disease with precision nutrition.**

**The Three-Layer Platform:**

**Layer 1: Prescription-Based Nutrition (The Clinical Foundation)**
- Medical nutrition therapy prescribed by providers
- Disease-specific meal plans (renal ≠ diabetes ≠ cardiac ≠ obesity)
- Culturally tailored to patient preferences and identity
- Delivered to patient's home with clinical oversight

**Layer 2: Integrated Care Delivery (The Clinical Team)**
- Registered Dietitian Nutritionists (medical nutrition therapy)
- Behavioral Health Navigators (adherence, SDOH, mental health)
- Care coordinators (logistics, family support, community resources)
- Medical directors (provider collaboration, clinical protocols)

**Layer 3: Data & Automation Infrastructure (The Scalability Engine)**
- **VozCare platform:** Care coordination, outcomes tracking, EHR integration
- **AVA AI agent:** Automated patient engagement, risk prediction, adherence monitoring
- **Outcomes reporting:** Real-time dashboards proving clinical and financial impact
- **Shared savings engine:** Calculating and distributing revenue from proven outcomes

**The Result:**
Hospitals get turnkey infrastructure for treating chronic disease with nutrition—as precise and provable as any other medical intervention.

### Why This Is a No-Brainer

**For Patients: Healing, Not Just Feeding**

❌ **Old approach:** "Here's a list of food pantries and some dietary guidelines"
✅ **Our approach:** "Your provider prescribed these specific meals for your kidney disease. They'll be delivered Tuesday. Your dietitian will call Wednesday to check on you."

**Outcomes:**
- HbA1c reduction: 1.8% average (diabetic patients moving to controlled)
- Weight loss: 12 lbs average (reducing cardiovascular risk)
- Blood pressure: 15 mmHg reduction (fewer cardiac events)
- Medication deprescribing: 30% rate (lower costs, fewer side effects)
- Patient satisfaction: 85% adherence rate (they actually use it)

**Translation:** People get healthier. Quality of life improves. Disease is managed instead of spiraling.

---

**For Hospitals: Revenue Generation + Penalty Avoidance + Capacity**

**1. Make More Money (Shared Savings Model)**
- 30% reduction in hospitalizations = $3,200 annual savings per high-risk patient
- Hospital shares in documented cost reductions (15-20% of savings)
- Example: 500 patients = $1.6M in savings = $240K-$320K shared savings to hospital
- This is new revenue, not cost reduction

**2. Avoid Penalties (Readmission Prevention)**
- Medicare penalizes hospitals for excess readmissions
- Nutrition intervention reduces preventable readmissions by 30-35%
- Example: 500 high-risk patients, 40% current readmission rate → prevent 60 readmissions
- At $25K penalty per readmission = $1.5M in avoided penalties

**3. Free Up Capacity (Keep Beds Available)**
- Fewer readmissions = more available beds
- More available beds = more elective procedures (higher-margin revenue)
- More available beds = shorter ER wait times (better patient satisfaction, HCAHPS scores)
- Example: 60 prevented readmissions = 300+ bed-days freed annually

**The Math:**
- **Investment:** $185-$325 PMPM (depending on patient acuity)
- **Return Year 1:** $240K shared savings + $1.5M avoided penalties + increased capacity
- **ROI:** 280% over 3 years
- **Break-even:** 6-9 months

**This isn't a cost center. This is a revenue generator that improves patient outcomes.**

---

**For Communities: Jobs + Wealth-Building + Health Equity**

**Old model:** Hospitals fund food pantries (charity, no economic development)

**Our model:** Hospitals contract with community-based organizations to produce and deliver medically-tailored meals

**Economic Impact:**
- **Jobs created:** Kitchen staff, delivery drivers, care coordinators, community health workers
- **Revenue to CBOs:** Fair-priced contracts for meal production and delivery
- **Shared savings participation:** CBOs earn portion of savings when outcomes improve
- **Workforce development:** Training pathways from community health worker → RDN → healthcare careers

**Health Equity Impact:**
- Culturally tailored nutrition (not generic "healthy food")
- Community members employed to serve their own communities
- Wealth stays in the community instead of extracting to corporate vendors
- Breaking cycles of chronic disease in underserved populations

**Example:**
Hartford partnership with community kitchen:
- 25 jobs created (15 production, 8 delivery, 2 coordinators)
- $180K annual revenue to CBO from meal production contracts
- $45K additional shared savings participation
- 2 community health workers now enrolled in RDN programs

**Translation:** Healthcare dollars building community wealth instead of leaving the community.

---

## Act 3: How It Actually Works

### Implementation: From Contract to Care in 60-90 Days

**Week 1-2: Partnership Design**
- Population risk stratification (identify high-risk chronic care patients)
- Care model selection (turnkey build vs. integrate with existing partnerships)
- Contract finalization (PMPM pricing + shared savings structure)

**Week 3-5: Infrastructure Deployment**
- VozCare platform setup and EHR integration planning
- Care team recruitment (RDNs, BHNs, coordinators) or training existing staff
- Food vendor partnerships (local CBOs + national capacity)
- Provider training and workflow design

**Week 6-8: Patient Enrollment Launch**
- First cohort enrollment (100-300 patients typical pilot)
- Initial assessments and care plan creation
- Meal delivery begins
- AVA AI check-ins start
- Real-time data collection activated

**Week 9+: Ongoing Care + Outcomes Measurement**
- Daily patient engagement via AVA
- Weekly RDN touchpoints
- Monthly outcomes reporting
- Quarterly shared savings calculations
- Continuous optimization based on data

**Timeline commitment:** 60-90 days from signature to first patient receiving medically-tailored meals with clinical oversight.

---

### The Patient Experience (How Healing Happens)

**Meet Maria: 62, Type 2 Diabetes + CHF + CKD**

**Before:**
- Hospital discharge with medication list and dietary guidelines
- Confused about renal diet restrictions
- Buying whatever's cheap at grocery store
- HbA1c: 9.8% (uncontrolled)
- Readmitted twice in 6 months

**After enrollment:**

**Day 1:** AVA calls
- "Hi Maria, I'm AVA from your care team. Your doctor prescribed a nutrition program. Can we talk about your food preferences?"
- Collects: cultural preferences (Puerto Rican), dietary restrictions, delivery logistics

**Day 3:** RDN assessment
- Video visit with registered dietitian
- Reviews medications, lab values, comorbidities
- Creates individualized care plan: low-sodium, low-potassium, diabetic-appropriate meals

**Day 5:** First meal delivery
- 14 medically-tailored meals delivered to home
- Labeled with heating instructions in Spanish
- Culturally familiar (arroz con gandules modified for renal diet)

**Ongoing:** Daily AVA check-ins
- "Good morning Maria! Did you eat breakfast? How are you feeling today?"
- Monitors adherence, symptoms, concerns
- Flags high-risk responses for immediate RDN follow-up

**Month 3:** Clinical improvements
- HbA1c: 8.1% (improving toward goal)
- Weight: -8 lbs
- Blood pressure: 138/82 (down from 156/94)
- Zero hospitalizations

**Month 6:** Sustained outcomes
- HbA1c: 7.2% (controlled)
- Weight: -14 lbs
- Medications: Reduced insulin dose, discontinued one BP med
- Patient satisfaction: "This program changed my life"

**The data flows:** VozCare → EHR → Hospital dashboard → Shared savings calculation

**The hospital sees:** One patient prevented from multiple readmissions = $15K+ in savings

**Multiply by 500 patients.**

That's the infrastructure impact.

---

### The Care Team Experience (How It Scales)

**Meet Sarah: Registered Dietitian Nutritionist**

**Old model (without infrastructure):**
- Manages 30-40 patients maximum
- Manual check-ins (phone calls, texts)
- Paper-based care plans
- No automated alerts
- Siloed from rest of care team
- No outcomes data to prove impact

**With Cena Health infrastructure:**
- Manages 75+ patients with AVA support
- Automated daily check-ins (AVA handles routine engagement)
- Digital care plans in VozCare (integrated with EHR)
- Real-time alerts for high-risk changes
- Coordinated with BHNs, care managers, medical team
- Outcomes dashboard showing her clinical impact

**Sarah's day:**

**8:00 AM:** Reviews AVA overnight alerts
- 3 patients flagged for concerning responses
- Prioritizes based on risk score

**8:30 AM:** High-priority patient calls
- Patient reported "feeling dizzy" to AVA
- Reviews recent vitals, medication changes
- Coordinates with BHN for home visit
- Notifies provider via EHR

**10:00 AM:** New patient assessments
- 5 new enrollments from hospital discharge
- Creates individualized care plans in VozCare
- System automatically generates meal prescriptions based on diagnoses + cultural preferences

**1:00 PM:** Routine follow-ups
- 8 patients scheduled for weekly check-ins
- Reviews adherence data (AVA already captured daily info)
- Adjusts care plans based on progress

**3:00 PM:** Care team coordination
- Virtual huddle with BHNs and care managers
- Reviews complex cases
- Plans interventions for at-risk patients

**4:00 PM:** Documentation and outcomes review
- VozCare auto-populates clinical notes
- Reviews population-level outcomes (average HbA1c, weight trends)
- Identifies patients ready for deprescribing conversations with providers

**Impact:**
- Sarah manages 2.5x more patients than before
- Spends more time on complex clinical work (less on routine check-ins)
- Has data proving her impact (outcomes dashboard)
- Feels supported by technology instead of overwhelmed

**That's how 1 RDN can serve hundreds of patients with quality care.**

- **$2.8M projected annual savings** (documented via claims data)
- HbA1c improvements: 1.6% average reduction
- Hospital utilization: 28% reduction
- Patient satisfaction: 82% would recommend

**What the CFO said:** "This pays for itself. Why didn't we do this sooner?"

---

**Hartford HealthCare: Transforming Existing Partnerships**

**Starting point:** Already funding community food programs. No clinical data. No ROI.

**What we added:** Clinical infrastructure layer over existing partnerships

**Results:**
- **35% readmission reduction** in CHF population
- Community partners now participate in shared savings
- Program expanded from pilot to system-wide
- CFO approved 3-year contract extension

**What the CMO said:** "This is what value-based care is supposed to look like."

---

**Community Impact (Jobs + Equity):**
- 25 jobs per market (production, delivery, care coordination)
- $180K+ annual revenue to community-based organizations
- Shared savings participation for CBOs
- Workforce development pathways

**The Translation:**
This isn't a pilot program. This is infrastructure that transforms how healthcare treats chronic disease.

---

## Act 5: The Opportunity (Why Investors Care)

### Market Timing: The Regulatory Forcing Function

**CMS is mandating this solution:**
- 2025-2026: Medicare expanding nutrition benefits
- State Medicaid: SDOH requirements accelerating (30+ states)
- Value-based care: 48% of payments (up from 34% in 2020)
- Medicare Advantage: 82% of plans adding food benefits by 2025

**Translation:** Hospitals must solve nutrition insecurity. The question is: Build in-house (3+ years) or deploy proven infrastructure (90 days)?

---

### Market Size: Massive Addressable Opportunity

- **$12B Food-as-Medicine market** by 2030
- **74M Medicare/Medicaid beneficiaries** eligible for nutrition interventions
- **6 in 10 Americans** with nutrition-related chronic conditions
- **$600B annual cost** of nutrition-related disease (preventable with proper intervention)

**Current penetration:** <1%

**The opportunity:** Infrastructure platform in underserved market with regulatory tailwinds

---

### Why We Win: The Only Integrated Infrastructure

**Competitors are either:**
- **Meal delivery companies** (no clinical integration, no disease specificity, no outcomes data)
- **Care coordination platforms** (no food component, no community partnerships)
- **Hospital-built programs** (too complex to scale, 3+ years to build)

**We're the only:**
- Prescription-based nutrition platform
- With integrated clinical care delivery
- With automated outcomes measurement
- With proven revenue generation model
- With turnkey 60-90 day deployment

**Defensible moat:**
- **Clinical integration:** RDN/BHN care teams + medical director oversight
- **Technical integration:** VozCare + AVA proprietary platform with EHR connectivity
- **Operational integration:** Multi-vendor food partnerships + community relationships + logistics

Competitors can't replicate one layer without the others. We built all three.

---

### Traction: Scaling Proven Demand

**Current:**
- 2,000 patients served with documented outcomes
- 5 health system partnerships with signed MSAs
- $4.2M annual run rate (from pilot programs)

**2025 Pipeline:**
- 12 health systems in active evaluation
- Expansion to 12 markets (CT, MD, VA, DC, TN, NY)
- 15,000 patients projected enrollment
- $18M revenue target

**Demand signals:**
- Inbound pipeline (they're coming to us)
- 90-day average sales cycle (fast for healthcare IT)
- 65% win rate at final decision
- Referral-driven growth from existing partners

**Translation:** This isn't pre-revenue. This is pre-scale.

---

### Unit Economics: How We Make Money

**Revenue model:**
- Primary: $185-$325 PMPM (immediate cash flow)
- Performance: 15-20% of shared savings (upside after 18 months)
- Government: Medicaid/Medicare contracts (scale path)

**Unit economics:**
- Average patient value: $2,220 annually (PMPM only)
- Cost to serve: $1,420 (meals + clinical + tech)
- Gross margin: 36% → improving to 45% at scale
- LTV:CAC: 19.6x (health system partnerships, not consumer acquisition)

**Path to profitability:**
- Break-even: ~3,500 patients
- Current: 2,000 patients
- Q1 2026 expansion: +2,800 patients (contracted pipeline)
- Projected profitability: Q3 2026

**Why margins improve:**
- Technology: Fixed cost base, scales efficiently
- Clinical care: AVA automation (1 RDN serves 75+ patients vs. 30-40)
- Meals: Volume improves vendor pricing
- Shared savings: Pure margin after 18 months

**Translation:** Strong unit economics in a business that scales efficiently.

## The Storyboard Summary (One-Page Version)

### The Problem
Hospitals lose $25B annually on preventable readmissions. The cause? **Nutrition insecurity**—chronic care patients can't access medically-tailored nutrition at home.

### What's Being Tried (And Why It Fails)
- Meal delivery companies: Food without clinical integration
- Care platforms: Care without food
- Hospital programs: Too complex to scale, 3+ years to build

### The Missing Infrastructure
Nobody built a platform combining:
1. Prescription-based nutrition (disease-specific, culturally tailored)
2. Integrated care delivery (RDNs, BHNs, medical oversight)
3. Automated outcomes tracking (proving clinical and financial impact)
4. Revenue generation (shared savings from reduced utilization)

### Our Solution: The No-Brainer
**For patients:** Precision nutrition healing chronic disease
**For hospitals:** Revenue generation + penalty avoidance + freed capacity
**For communities:** Jobs + wealth-building + health equity

### How It Works
60-90 day deployment → Medically-tailored meals + clinical care team → Daily AI engagement → Real-time outcomes data → Shared savings distribution

### The Proof
- 2,000 patients served with documented outcomes
- 30% reduction in hospitalizations
- $3,200 annual savings per patient
- 280% ROI over 3 years
- 5 health systems with signed contracts

### The Opportunity
- $12B market by 2030
- 74M eligible beneficiaries
- Regulatory tailwinds (CMS mandates)
- <1% current penetration
- Defensible infrastructure moat

### The Ask
Series A $8M to scale from 2,000 → 15,000 patients across 12 markets by 2025

### The Vision
Become the clinical infrastructure standard for treating chronic disease with precision nutrition—improving lives, building community wealth, and generating sustainable healthcare revenue.
