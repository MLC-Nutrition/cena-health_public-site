# Cena Health Narrative Outline (High-Level)

## The Story We're Telling

### Act 1: The Problem — Doctors Can't Actually Help Patients "Eat Better"

**Opening:** Hospitals lose $25B annually on preventable readmissions for chronic care patients.

**The Reality:** When a doctor tells a patient "you need to eat better," there's no infrastructure to make that happen. Patients leave with a pamphlet and maybe see a dietitian twice a year. That's not treatment—it's inadequate care.

**The Comparison That Clarifies:**

- **Medications work seamlessly:** Doctor prescribes → pharmacy fills → insurance pays → patient receives ongoing treatment
- **Nutrition doesn't work at all:** Doctor advises "eat better" → patient is on their own → no follow-through → readmission

**Why It's Failing:**

- Hospitals can't prescribe ongoing nutrition support like they prescribe medications
- Medically-tailored food providers deliver but have no clinical oversight or hospital integration
- Dietitians counsel patients but have no way to ensure follow-through or coordinate with medical team
- Behavioral health therapists address mental barriers but aren't connected to nutrition care
- Care coordination platforms track patients but don't include food delivery

**The Result:** Fragmented care from well-intentioned people working in silos. Patients still get readmitted for the same chronic conditions over and over.

**The Core Problem:** There's no cohesive infrastructure connecting continual nutrition delivery + clinical support + behavioral health + hospital workflows. Nothing works like the prescription drug infrastructure that doctors rely on.

### Act 2: The Solution — Infrastructure That Works Like Prescriptions, But For Nutrition

**What We Built:** The missing infrastructure that makes nutrition work as seamlessly as medications.

**How It Integrates With Hospitals:**

- Connects directly to hospital EHRs (Epic, Athena, Cerner)
- Works within existing referral workflows (no new burden on staff)
- Bills insurance and manages revenue cycle (just like any other treatment)
- Functions as an internal part of hospital care delivery (not an external vendor)

**The Three Layers:**

1. **Continual medically-tailored foods** (condition-specific meals + produce, delivered to home, culturally relevant)
2. **Integrated clinical care** (RDNs, behavioral health navigators, care coordinators working together with hospital teams)
3. **Data & automation** (VozCare platform + AVA AI tracking outcomes, coordinating care, proving ROI)

**Why It Works:** Nutrition finally works like any other medical intervention—prescribed, coordinated, tracked, and billed seamlessly within hospital workflows.

### Act 3: Why This Is a No-Brainer

**For Patients:** Healing instead of endless readmissions (HbA1c drops, hospitalizations prevented, quality of life restored)

**For Hospitals:**

- **No added workload** (integrates with existing referral processes and EHRs)
- **Saves money** (avoided readmission penalties)
- **Makes money** (shared savings revenue + freed bed capacity for higher-margin procedures)
- **Improves outcomes** (patients with chronic disease actually get better)
- **280% ROI over 3 years**

**For Communities:** Jobs + local wealth-building + health equity

### Act 4: The Proof

**Real outcomes from real health systems:**

- UConn Health: $2.8M projected savings, 28% utilization reduction
- Hartford HealthCare: 35% readmission reduction
- Kaiser Mid-Atlantic: Scaling to 3 markets with AI automation

**The data:** 30% fewer hospitalizations, $3,200 savings per patient, 85% adherence rate
