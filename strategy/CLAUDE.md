# Strategy Directory Rules

## Purpose of This Directory

The `/strategy/` directory contains audience definitions, messaging frameworks, go-to-market planning, and strategic positioning. This is where research insights become actionable plans.

## Source of Truth Documents

### [target-audiences.md](target-audiences.md) - Audience Definitions & Messaging

**This is the authoritative source for:**
- Primary audience segments (3 health system maturity levels)
- Secondary audiences (CBOs, payers, investors)
- Pain points and core needs by segment
- Key messages tailored to each audience
- Language to use for each segment
- Portal flow by audience maturity

**When creating content for any audience:**
1. Check [target-audiences.md](target-audiences.md) for their segment definition first
2. Understand their maturity level / current state
3. Match messaging to their core need
4. Use their language and frame benefits in their terms
5. Address their specific objections

5. **Support with proof:** Pull metrics from research/core-competencies or sitemaps
