## What Sets Us Apart (Core Differentiators)

### We're a Prescriber, Not a Food Vendor

- Disease-specific meal plans (not blanket "healthy food")
- Clinical care plans individualized to patient conditions and culture
- Medical-grade approach: end-stage renal ≠ uncontrolled diabetes ≠ cardiac disease

### We Build Infrastructure, Not Just Deliver Food

- **Data layer:** Collecting structured + unstructured clinical data
- **Care layer:** RDNs, BHNs, care coordination (what food vendors don't provide)
- **Food layer:** Multi-vendor partnerships for patient choice + cultural relevance (what clinical teams can't do alone)

### We Generate Revenue, Not Just Costs

- Shared savings model - hospitals make money while improving outcomes
- Proven ROI through utilization reduction (30% fewer hospitalizations, 25% fewer ER visits)
- Only platform enabling community-based organizations to contribute to hospital revenue through clinical impact

### We Enable Continuity of Care

- VozCare platform integrates with Epic and major EHRs
- Real-time dashboards with AI-powered recommendations
- Automated care coordination that scales without proportional staff increases

  We provide the clinical data infrastructure and care coordination that lets CBOs demonstrate measurable impact and participate in value-based care models.
