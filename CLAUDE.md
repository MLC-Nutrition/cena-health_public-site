# CenaHealth Project Rules

## Project Context

CenaHealth is a healthcare infrastructure company providing integrated nutrition-first care delivery. We're in the **planning and copywriting phase** for our public-facing website, focused on investor and hospital partner acquisition.

**Current Phase:** Pre-development - sitemaps, copy, strategy, brand voice development

**NOT YET:** Building features, writing code, implementing technical solutions

## Brand Voice & Messaging

**ALL VOICE GUIDELINES:** [brand/voice.md](brand/voice.md) - the single source of truth for Cena Health voice.

All written content in this project must follow the voice defined in that file:
- Direct and concise communication (skip preambles, lead with action)
- Accuracy over speed (always cite sources, data-driven claims only)
- Healthcare infrastructure positioning (platform, not food vendor)
- Professional but approachable tone with specific metrics
- Cultural competency and dignified representation

**For complete details, tone variations by audience, language preferences, and examples - see [brand/voice.md](brand/voice.md).**

## Key Strategic References

**Target Audiences:** [strategy/target-audiences.md](strategy/target-audiences.md) - Complete audience definitions, pain points, and messaging by segment

**Core Competencies:** [research/core-competencies.md](research/core-competencies.md) - Our 7 strategic advantages and differentiators

Always reference these when creating content to ensure accurate messaging for each audience and proper emphasis on our unique value.

## Content Development Guidelines

### When Writing Copy

1. **Always reference:** target-audiences.md for messaging by segment
2. **Lead with data:** Use metrics from investor-partner-sitemap.md
3. **Emphasize differentiation:** Reference core-competencies.md
4. **Match voice:** Professional, data-driven, confident (see Brand Voice section above)
5. **Structure for scanning:** Bullets, subheads, short paragraphs

### When Creating Sitemaps

1. **Audience-first structure:** Guide users based on their maturity level or role
2. **Clear conversion paths:** Every section needs relevant CTAs
3. **Proof points throughout:** Case studies, metrics, testimonials
4. **Progressive disclosure:** Basic info first, depth on demand

### When Doing Research

1. **Look for proof points:** Outcomes data, case studies, testimonials
2. **Identify gaps:** What competitors miss that we solve
3. **Find language patterns:** How do health systems talk about these problems?
4. **Validate assumptions:** Does our messaging match market needs?

## Output Preferences

### Formatting
- Use markdown for all documents
- Include clear section headers
- Add internal links to related documents
- Use tables for comparisons
- Use callouts for key points

### File Organization
- `/brand/` - Voice, visual identity, brand guidelines
- `/research/` - Market research, competitor analysis, sitemaps
- `/strategy/` - Audience definitions, messaging frameworks, go-to-market
- `/public/` - (Future) Actual site content when ready to build

## What NOT to Do

- ❌ Don't start building/coding without explicit direction
- ❌ Don't use generic healthcare platitudes
- ❌ Don't bury the lead - put outcomes first
- ❌ Don't write long paragraphs (3 sentences max)
- ❌ Don't use emojis in professional copy (unless explicitly requested)
- ❌ Don't forget to reference the audience segmentation when writing
- ❌ Don't create generic "About Us" content - tie everything to value props

## Proactive Behaviors

When I ask for help with copy or sitemaps:

1. **Ask clarifying questions:**
   - Which audience segment?
   - What's the goal/CTA?
   - Where in the buyer journey?
   - Any specific proof points to emphasize?

2. **Offer alternatives:**
   - Provide 2-3 headline options
   - Show different structural approaches
   - Suggest A/B testing opportunities

3. **Reference context:**
   - Pull relevant data from research docs
   - Cite specific differentiators from core-competencies.md
   - Match messaging to audience from target-audiences.md

4. **Think conversion:**
   - Every section should move someone toward action
   - Suggest relevant CTAs
   - Consider gated content opportunities

## Current Priorities

As of project start:
1. Refining messaging for investor site
2. Developing copy that converts investors and hospital partners
3. Creating sitemaps for multi-audience portal architecture
4. Defining brand voice more comprehensively
5. Researching competitive positioning

**Remember:** We're in the strategic planning and copywriting phase. Focus on messaging, structure, and content strategy - NOT implementation or code.
